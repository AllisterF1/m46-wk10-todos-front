GH strategy

branches:

main:
    dev:
        feature branches (e.g. feature/login):
            personal branches (e.g. enhancement/login_addfetch_mz)

Organise the naming of the feature banches arung the user stories; the names
do not have to exactly match but should reflect the tasks that will be performed. 

The project will follow a rebasing strategy to ensure that each developer
is working from the most recent production code. 

Strategy is as follows:

    1. Switch to dev locally and; 
        git pull
    
    2. Swtich to relevant feature branch and; 
    
        git rebase dev

    3. Make a new branch from which to work;

        git switch -c <actionDescription>/<featurename>_<activity>_<initials>

        example branch name; enhancement/login_addfetch_mz

        bugfix/message_typofix_mz

    4. Push to GH

    5. Merge with relevant feature branch;

        e.g. merge enhancement/login_addfetch_mz with feature/login

        delete enhancement/login_addfetch_mz

    6. Merge feature branch with dev;

        e.g. merge feature/login with dev

        DO NOT DELETE feature/login

    7. When ready, merge dev with main 

        DO NOT DELETE dev

    8. Switch to dev locally, git pull and repeat process
